\subsection{Vocational}
\cventry{July 2010--Today}{Embedded Linux Engineer}{Overkiz SAS, Somfy group}{Archamps}{}{Overkiz is developing home-automation solutions to control different home devices over Internet. It consists of a gateway and server applications. The gateway runs an Embedded Linux system.\newline{}
\begin{itemize}
\item I am co-maintainer of our homemade Embedded Linux distribution. I am responsible of the software deployment for the embedded part.
\item I set up the Yocto Build System that builds the software of the box. It builds from scratch the whole embedded software.
\item I develop homemade frameworks and applications to support new RF protocols into our gateways. I was also in charge of developing the application that creates the connection between the box and the server. Frameworks and applications are both developed in C++.
\item I have developed Linux kernel modules and I did board bring up and maintain them inside the kernel sources.
\item I have also contributed to Open-Source projects (see Open-Source Contribution section).

\subsection{Training Periods}
\cventry{2009}{Trainee}{LC Mobility}{Australia}{}{I made a market search about the mobility of the Australian students.}
\cventry{2008}{Trainee Engineer}{Freescale Semiconductors}{Toulouse}{}{I was responsible for the development of a battery-charging driver on Freescale smart phone platform (ARM-11 based).

I saw in your last blog post, from Tuesday June 9th, that you are seeking for kernel developers to join your team, and I would be pleased if you take the present application into consideration.

I am currently in charge of the embedded software team at Overkiz, a company providing home-automation services. For the last 5 years, I have been developing frameworks and applications in C/C++ for our home-made embedded Linux distribution. I also created and maintained our distribution using the Yocto Project.

At the beginning of this year I endorsed a new role, and part of this new assignment was about bringing up two new boards based on two different Atmel SoCs. Developing the BSPs was so interesting that I decided to go further. I started to have a look into the Linux kernel internals to understand how it is working. It is really exciting to discover how both, kernel and hardware, interact each others.

That experience led me to contribute to Open-Source projects and showed me how rewarding it is to participate to this huge community; and I would like to be a part of it. Any changes we make can be useful to other people. My contributions to the Open Source Community are relatively recent and quite limited, but it will grow up soon, especially if you offer me the possibility to work with you. My major contribution consist in bringing support for UBI into the Atmel Bootstrap project. I am currently trying to mainline it.

Another aspect of the position you are offering is the training part. Unfortunately, this is not something I have been doing so far, except for internal trainings given to new comers. I think this is something I would enjoy. Explaining software concepts or detailing how software components are working is already something I am doing in my current position, and hopefully giving a training will not be so different.

I saw that engineers from Free-Electrons travel to give presentations and formations. I do not see any constraint but a chance to travel to international for work. I spent one year travelling around Australia/New-Zealand, 6 years ago. It is a great experience to meet people from abroad and to share with them. I would love to travel in the context of work, even for short periods of time.

For all the reasons detailed above, I think I might match the profile you are looking for. I am thrilling about the idea of working with talented and experienced developers.

You will find attached my resume detailing my technical skills and my professional experience. If you have any further questions, do not hesitate to contact me. I am looking forward to hearing from you.
